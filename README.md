# Python Script Quality Evaluation

This project simulates structured evaluation of Python scripts using a defined quality rubric.
It mirrors tasks common in AI training and software benchmarking environments.

## Project Overview

- Efficiency
- Documentation quality

The evaluations are documented consistently to demonstrate reliability and precision.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Analytical reasoning
- Consistent application of evaluation guidelines
- Written technical justification
